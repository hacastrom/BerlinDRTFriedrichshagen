	--> For each time slice (0:00, 1:00, 2:00...) & For each link: 
		--> document link enter event and link leave event
	  	--> calculate travel times on link
	  	--> find average travel time per link per time slice
	  	--> find congested freespeed by dividing by link length
	--> create time dependent network, where freespeeds change each hour.
	--> pt : delete bus routes from Fronau  	


*** B : Define our Population ***

*** E : Analysis ***
	--> How did travel times change for subpop
	--> how many pt legs vs. car legs
