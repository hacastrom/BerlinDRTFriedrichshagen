Project Outline (as of June 19, 2019) 
*** A : Set up Network ***
	--> Download 10% Events File Berlin -- https://svn.vsp.tu-berlin.de/repos/public-svn/matsim/scenarios/countries/de/berlin/berlin-v5.3-10pct/output-berlin-v5.3-10pct/
	--> For each time slice (0:00, 1:00, 2:00...) & For each link: 
		--> document link enter event and link leave event
	  	--> calculate travel times on link
	  	--> find average travel time per link per time slice
	  	--> find congested freespeed by dividing by link length
	--> create time dependent network, where freespeeds change each hour.
	--> pt : delete bus routes from Fronau  	


*** B : Define our Population ***
	--> Create Shapefile of Fronau
	--> Delete all People who do not have main activity in Frohnau. 

*** C : Set up DRT ***
	--> Generate drt vehicles
	--> Modify S-Fronau with attribute : drtAccessible

*** D : Run ***
	--> Set up config
	--> Run

*** E : Analysis ***
	--> How did travel times change for subpop
	--> how many pt legs vs. car legs
	
### B ###
1) Remove pt Routes (161)

stop can only have pt,walk

Make Network
-add attribute to stations: DRTStation
-allow DRT mode on links in Frohnau
-add DRT stop facilities? 
Add DRT vehicles
Configure Routing
Configure QSim
Configure Scoring?

Test Multimodal access egress to train stations (with bike, for instance)
Test DRT
Test combination

Population
We decided to limit our study on people who conducted activities within Frohnau (such as "home" or "work", but not
"pt interaction"). The first step of this process was to draw a polygon that encompassed Frohnau on QGis and export it
as a shape file. The second step was to write a Java script which loaded the berlin output population file and the
Frohnau shape file, and produced a subpopulation as the output. The full population was filtered in the following manner:
+ if the agent is a actually a person (not freight, etc.)
+ if the activity type is not "pt interaction", "car interaction" or "ride interaction"
+ if the coordinate of at least one activity falls within the bounds of the shape file

During the time of the project, modes "access_walk" and "egress_walk" were replaced in MATSim by "non_network_walk". The
reason for this change relates to intermodal access and egress, and is therefore relevant to our project. The reasoning is
that if you take a taxi to a train station and need to walk a short bit between those modes, then the walk would be an
simultaneously be access walk (with respect to pt) and an egress walk (with respect to the taxi). Therefore the existing
modes don't adequately describe intermodal transporation, and a new mode was coined, namely "non_network_walk". This mode
replaces access_walk and egress_walk. We changed all instances of access_walk and egress_walk to non_network_walk in our
input populations in the data preparation phase of our project.

Access Egress



drt

Assumptions:
+ Marginal Utility of Travelling: we set our marginal utility of travelling for mode "Zoomer" to 0.0. This value matches
the parameter for pt. Some people may Zoomer better than pt, since it is an experience closer to being chaueffered in a taxi.
Others may rate the Zoomer experience as worse than pt, as you are stuck in an driverless car, with people you do not know. Therefore
we took the safe value of 0.
+ We decided not to add any fares to our zoomer, since it meant to be used in conjunction with pt. The idea is that there
should be no cost to transfer from zoomer to pt, and since agents are already charged for pt, we do not incur an additional charge.
+ We set the velocity of zoomer to 25 km/h. This is reasonable, since there is not a lot of traffic in Frohnau, so the zoomer vehicles
will not often be stuck.
+ The standard beeline factor for car is 1.3, which is what we implemented as well. The beeline factor for drt is obviously higher
than that of car, since drt vehicles often take detours in order to pick up or drop off more customers. We decided, however,
that the factor shouldn't be increased by too much since all trips either start or end in S-Fronhau, meaning that the detours only
occur in the pick-up phase or drop-off phase, and not in both. Also, we assume that an efficient alogorithm is developed for
optimizing pick-ups and drop offs. Finally, in times of low demand, there is a high chance that only one agent will be picked up by the
drt vehicle; therefore, in many trips the drt vehicle will not have to make any more detours than a car. Therefore, we set
the beeline factor for drt to be 25% higher than that of car, namely 1.625.
+ We set the radius for zoomer to 3 km. This is realistic, the distance from S-Frohnau to the farsest bound of Frohnau was approximately
3 km. Frohnau is relatively isolated from other parts of the city, there also won't be a lot of people using drt from outside of the city.
